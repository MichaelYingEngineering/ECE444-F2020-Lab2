Briefly summarize the Flask context globals:

The Flask context globals are variables that can be used when application and request contexts are activated. The contexts are activated to handle or dispatch requests. The current_app variable is the active application instance, g is an object used for temporary storage, request is an object containing information on the current request, and session is a dictionary which stores values that last between requests.
